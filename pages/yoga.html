	<h1>Yoga</h1>
	<p>Yoga has been a big enrichment of my life for the past 3 years. When I started, I was so immobile and not at all flexible. It was very frustrating seeing all the other people doing poses etc. when I wasn't even able to touch my toes.</p>
	<p>Now I understand that Yoga is not at all about being flexible, being stretchy and strong. It is about doing something for your health and well-being, listening to your body and accepting your limitations without pushing or expecting your body to do things it just can't.</p>

	<p>What most people understand as doing yoga, the physical aspect of it - called <em>Asana</em>, is just one small part of yoga.</p>
	<p>There are <strong>8 limbs of yoga</strong> (called the <em>Ashtanga Yoga System</em>) which are the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Yama - self-behavior
			<ul>
				<li>Ahimsa: non-violence</li>
				<li>Satya: truthfulness</li>
				<li>Asteya: non-stealing</li>
				<li>Brahmacharya: abstinence</li>
				<li>Aparigraha: non-grasping</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>

		<li>Niyama - observances
			<ul>
				<li>Saucha: cleanliness</li>
				<li>Santosha: contentment (with what already is)</li>
				<li>Tapas: asceticism/discipline</li>
				<li>Svadyaya: self-study</li>
				<li>Isvara Pranidhana: surrendering to a higher power</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>

		<li>Asana - physical (body) postures</li>
		<li>Pranayama - breathing exercises</li>
		<li>Pratyahara - withdrawal of the senses</li>
		<li>Dharana - concentration</li>
		<li>Dhyana - meditation</li>
		<li>Samadhi - enlightenment</li>
	</ol>
