		<h1>Yoga</h1>
		<p>Yoga has been a big enrichment of my life for the past 3 years.
		When I started, I was so immobile and not at all flexible.
		It was very frustrating seeing all the other people doing poses etc.
		when I wasn't even able to touch my toes.</p>
		<p>Now I understand that Yoga is not at all about being flexible, being
		stretchy and strong. It is about doing something for your health and well-being,
		listening to your body and accepting your limitations without pushing or
		expecting your body to do things it just can't do.</p>
		<p>What most people understand as doing yoga, the physical aspect of it - called
		<em>Asana</em>, is just one small part of yoga.</p>
		<p>There are <strong>8 limbs of yoga</strong> (called the <em>Ashtanga Yoga System</em>)
		which are the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Yama - self-behavior
				<ul>
					<li>Ahimsa: non-violence</li>
					<li>Satya: truthfulness</li>
					<li>Asteya: non-stealing</li>
					<li>Brahmacharya: abstinence</li>
					<li>Aparigraha: non-grasping</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>Niyama - observances
				<ul>
					<li>Saucha: cleanliness</li>
					<li>Santosha: contentment (with what already is)</li>
					<li>Tapas: asceticism/discipline</li>
					<li>Svadyaya: self-study</li>
					<li>Isvara Pranidhana: surrendering to a higher power</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>Asana - physical (body) postures</li>
			<li>Pranayama - breathing exercises</li>
			<li>Pratyahara - withdrawal of the senses</li>
			<li>Dharana - concentration</li>
			<li>Dhyana - meditation</li>
			<li>Samadhi - enlightenment</li>
		</ol>
