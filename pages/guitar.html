		<h1>My guitar journey</h1>
		<p>I started playing the guitar about 6 years ago. A friend of mine always had his
		electrical guitar standing in the living room and some day I wanted to try and play
		something. It was the riff of the Artic Monkeys song <em>"Do I Wanna Know"</em>.
		A few weeks later I bought my very first electrical guitar and never looked back since.</p>
		<p>A few years ago I was really into playing the electric guitar, playing some heavy riffs
		or learning my favorite solos, usually from Black Sabbath or similar bands.
		Nowadays I prefer playing my western guitar, strumming or playing fingerstyle songs while singing to them.</p>

		<h2>Why the guitar is arguably the best instrument:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>versatile</li>
			<li>small and transportable</li>
			<li>lots of different sounds possible</li>
		</ul>
