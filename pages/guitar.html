	<h1>My guitar journey</h1>

	<p>I started playing the guitar about 6 years ago. A friend of mine always had his electrical guitar standing in the living room and some day I wanted to try and play something. It was the riff of the Artic Monkeys song "Do I Wanna Know". A few weeks later I bought my very first electrical guitar and never looked back since.</p>
	<p>A few years ago I was really into playing the electric guitar, playing some heavy riffs or learning my favorite solos, usually from Black Sabbath or similar bands. Nowadays I prefer playing my western guitar, strumming or playing fingerstyle songs while singing to them.</p>

	<h2>Why the guitar is arguably the best instrument:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>versatile</li>
		<li>small and transportable</li>
		<li>lots of different sounds possible</li>
		<li>girl magnet (optional) :)</li>
	</ul>
