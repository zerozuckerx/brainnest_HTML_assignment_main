	<h1>Van life</h1>
	<p>One of my favorite things to do in summer is borrowing my stepfather's van and living outside for a few weeks at a time, living in the car, hopping from lake to lake, mountain to mountain and just spend time outdoors in nature.</p>
	<p>Some day I want to buy my own, build the interior myself and follow the warm weather throughout Europe!</p>
