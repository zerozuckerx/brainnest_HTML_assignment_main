	<p>Hey guys! My Name is Daniel, I am 29 years old from Vienna and started my programming journey in March 2022 when I was travelling South-East Asia.</p>

	<p>Why did I start programming you might ask yourself? Here are some reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I want to live abroad some day and be able to work remotely</li>
		<li>it is usually paid well</li>
		<li>programming is fun! </li>
		<li>even tho it seems quite strict and orderly, there is a lot of freedom and creativity involved</li>
	</ul>
